abstract: 'A system for measuring the orientation and power of sphero-cylindrical lenses has been developed. The system attempts
to minimize the need for specialized equipment and training and instead relies on the ubiquitous cell phone camera, a
magnetic stripe card, and a target pattern. By capturing an image of the target through the lenses under test and analyzing
the distortion in the resulting image, the orientation and powers on sphero-cylindrical lenses can be determined. In modern
eye clinics, the measurement of sphero-cylindrical spectacle lenses is readily measured with a lensmeter. However, there
are many examples where this measurement is not feasible. This may include remote or rural locations where access to
eye care may not exist, or require impractical travel. Furthermore, the on-going global pandemic has often put restrictions
on contact between the patient and the eye care provider. Telemedicine, which can connect patients to eye care providers,
lacks physical access to the spectacles for measurement. The system developed in this effort overcomes this limitation by
allowing remote measurement of the lenses with items found in most households. Such a system would be beneficial to
often underserved populations and expand access to quality eye care'
