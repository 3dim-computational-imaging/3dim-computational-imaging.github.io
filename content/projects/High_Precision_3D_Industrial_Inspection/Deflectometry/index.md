Accurate and fast 3D imaging of specular surfaces still poses major challenges for state-of-the-art optical measurement principles. Frequently used methods, such as phase-measuring deflectometry (PMD) or shape-from-polarization (SfP), rely on strong assumptions about the measured objects, limiting their generalizability for broader application areas like medical imaging, industrial inspection, virtual reality, or cultural heritage analysis.
We introduce a measurement principle that utilizes a novel technique to effectively encode and decode the information contained in a light field reflected off a specular surface. We combine polarization cues from SfP with geometric information obtained from PMD to resolve all arising ambiguities in the 3D measurement. Moreover, our approach removes the unrealistic orthographic projection assumption for SfP, significantly improving the respective results. We showcase our new technique by demonstrating single-shot and multi-shot measurements on complex-shaped specular surfaces, displaying an evaluated accuracy of surface normals below 0.6 degrees.
