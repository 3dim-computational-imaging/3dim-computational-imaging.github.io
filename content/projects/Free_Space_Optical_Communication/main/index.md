Ultrafast communication is vital to the modern world, as many applications require efficient data transferrals. The fastest communications are done optically, generally through the use of fiber-optic cables. While efficient, fiber optics are costly to manufacture, to lay down, and to maintain. 

As an alternative, *Free Space Optical (FSO) Communication* can be performed, where a beam is fired through the open air. This could allow high-speed connections in low-resource areas, and can enable fast communications with moving targets like vehicles. While promising, FSO systems tend to be limited by atmospheric turbulence, which disperses long-distance beams until they are no longer detectable.

This problem can be greatly mitigated, though not entirely removed, by using an Adaptive Optics (AO) system, which attempts to correct for the effects of turbulence on the transmitting beam. We are developing an AO system based on a novel wavefront correction device, the Texas Instruments Phase Light Modulator, which has significantly higher resolution compared to other wavefront correction devices commonly used for AO.
