      subtitle: Imaging through scattering media or around corners at high resolution
      text: |
        Synthetic Wavelength Holography introduces a novel solution to image through scattering media, or around the corner at the physical space bandwidth limit. 
        Current state-of-the-art approaches are either technically limited by the low spatial and temporal resolution of time-of-flight detectors, or by a very narrow viewing angle in which the 
        hidden scene can be reconstructed. In our approach, we beat together light at two closely spaced optical frequencies to produce a low frequency 'synthetic wave’ (beat wave), largely immune 
        to the unknown scattering processes between hidden scene and detector. A ‘synthetic hologram’ of the hidden scene can be acquired within milliseconds. Since the ‘synthetic wavelength’ is 
        freely tunable, the captured hologram provides a window to fully reconstruct the three-dimensional light field of the hidden scene at the best possible resolution.
