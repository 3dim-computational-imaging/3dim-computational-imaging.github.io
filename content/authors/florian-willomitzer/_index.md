Florian Willomitzer an Associate Professor at the Wyant College of Optical Sciences and directs the Computational 3D Imaging and Measurement (3DIM) Lab. He graduated from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany, where he received his Ph.D. degree with honors (‘summa cum laude’) in 2017. During his doctoral studies, he investigated physical and information-theoretical limits of optical 3D-sensing for medical imaging and industrial inspection, and implemented sensors that operate close to these limits.

In the 3DIM Lab, Prof. Willomitzer and his team work on novel methods to image hidden objects through scattering media or around corners, high-resolution holographic displays, unconventional methods for precise VR eye-tracking, and the implementation of high-precision metrology methods in low-cost mobile handheld devices. Moreover, the group develops novel time-of-flight and structured light imaging techniques working at depth resolutions in the 100μm-range.

Prof. Willomitzer serves/served as Chair and Committee Member of several Optica COSI conferences, Optics Chair of the 2022 IEEE ICCP conference, Chair and Host of the Optica Incubator on Imaging Through 100 Scattering Lengths, Committee member of Optica FiO conferences and as reviewer for Nature, Optica (OSA), SPIE, IEEE and CVPR. He is a recipient of the NSF CRII grant, winner of the Optica 20th Anniversary Challenge, and his Ph.D. thesis was awarded with the Springer Theses Award for Outstanding Ph.D. Research.
